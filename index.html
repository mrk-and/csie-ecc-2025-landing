      <p>
        Autonomous systems are rapidly gaining popularity across safety-critical domains such as transportation (both in
        the air and on the ground), logistics, healthcare, and space exploration. However, ensuring their safe,
        efficient, and reliable operation remains a significant challenge, especially in dynamic, uncertain, and
        adversarial environments.Addressing these challenges requires a synergistic integration of dynamical systems and
        control theory, machine learning, and optimization techniques. This workshop will explore the latest
        advancements in control and learning strategies for autonomous systems, with a focus on ensuring safety and
        robustness in autonomous systems. Key topics include but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Safety-critical control for autonomous systems;</li>
        <li>Safe and robust learning in dynamic and uncertain environments;</li>
        <li>Formal methods for learning and control;</li>
        <li>Decentralized decision-making, control, and learning for multi-agent autonomous systems;</li>
        <li>Applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, aerospace, and beyond.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This workshop aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementations by bringing
        together experts in control theory, machine learning, robotics, and game theory. Through invited talks and
        interactive discussions, we will promote a deeper understanding of safety-critical learning and control
        methodologies for autonomous and multi-agent systems. This workshop will provide a platform for researchers and
        practitioners to exchange ideas, identify open challenges, and explore future directions in this rapidly
        evolving
        field.
